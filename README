This is my submission to the final project of the Internshala Programming with Python Online Training.
Problem Statement:
    Build a desktop application which is a fantasy cricket game where you would create a
    virtual team of cricket players and score points on how the players perform in different
    matches.
    
The Project Synopsis file describes my project and its features completely and how to use it.



P.S. To see Stats of a player, single click on the player's name and drag the mouse pointer.
